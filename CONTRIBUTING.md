Thank you for your interest in `idv`!

This project welcomes all contributors. Please read over the following for guidelines on what and how to contribute.

## Conduct
First and foremost, if you are interacting with another person in the shared spaces of this project, please be respectful, constructive, and patient. We all have different backgrounds and different preferences; this makes us stronger as long as we are respectful of each other!

## Guidelines
1. For most types of contributions, please open a GitHub Issue before writing and submitting a Pull Request. This helps us decide what and how to improve the project collaboratively before a large amount of code needs to be read/reviewed and then likely either mostly accepted or mostly turned down. _Small bug fixes and corrections to typos are notable exceptions to this guideline_.
2. This project is really young and for better or worse I (the creator) have not decided exactly how broad its features should be or how targetted its purpose should be. I encourage you to help me figure that out by submitted any and all ideas or suggestions even if you aren't going to implement them yourself!
3. If you would like to contribute but aren't burning to take on a particular feature you just dreamt up, take a look at the Issues or the Wish List in the [README](https://github.com/mattpolzin/idv/blob/main/README.md) for ideas.
